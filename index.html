    <h1> Cyber Virus</h1>
    <h2>By Nan Zhang</h2>
    <p>In the not-so-distant future, the digital realm has become a breeding ground for a new kind of terror: cyber viruses. 
      These insidious programs do more than just harm computers; they have evolved to interface with the human brain, 
      causing psychological horrors that blur the lines between reality and the digital world. As humanity becomes increasingly integrated with technology, 
      the threat of these viruses grows, 
      manifesting not only in our devices but within our very thoughts, turning our own minds into mazes of fear and confusion.</p>
